# FirebaseTry
Created multiple projects to be used as samples.

You would need the google-services.json file for these projects to work.

To create your google-services.json:

1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Go to Tools->Firebase to open the assistant window.
3. Expand any one of the modules and click the connect to firebase button and you're good to go.
